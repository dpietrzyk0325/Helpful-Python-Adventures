Handy Python scripts I made to make my life easier

I am usually a C/C++ fundamentalist, but for ease of writing programs in less time for them to work, Python is pretty nice.

I still recommend you start learning program with C/C++ (not that you have to), because then you have a better understanding / appreciation for high-level languages.
